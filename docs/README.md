# Front End Fundamentals

- Static web pages
- They don't collect data.
- Web site without a backend. 

- Deploy a static web site to github pages for free, super easily. 

## HTML

- Hypertext markup language.
- It's a tree, like most view hierarchies.
- `head`, `body`, `header`, `footer`, `div`
- It makes your text hyper and marked up.
- Is just the data. 

## CSS

- Cascading style sheets
- Styling language
- Color, styling layout.

- you can't add logic. 

use a `#` to refer to an id, use a `.` to refer to a class.

## JavaScript

- Up until very recently, javascript was the only option.
- Kinda looks like an unsafe version of swift
- dynamic language
- `coffeescript`, `typescript`, `flow`.

- DOM Document Object Model.
